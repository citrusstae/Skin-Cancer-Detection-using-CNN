**Skin Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

**Overview**

This repository implements a CNN-based model for classifying skin lesions as benign or malignant. It aims to aid in early diagnosis and potentially improve skin cancer outcomes.

**Code Structure**

- **data/**: Stores the skin cancer image dataset (benign and malignant subfolders).
- **src/**: Contains Python code for model development and evaluation:
    - `model.py`: Defines the CNN architecture.
    - `train.py`: Implements the training process.
    - `evaluate.py` (optional): Evaluates the model's performance on a test set.
    - `utils.py` (optional): Houses utility functions for data preprocessing and visualization.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists required Python libraries.
- **README.md**: This file.

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone Repository:** Use Git to clone this repository.
2. **Set Up Environment:** Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Download Dataset:** Acquire a suitable skin cancer dataset (e.g., HAM10000, ISIC Archive) and place it in the `data` directory with a `benign` and a `malignant` subfolder.
4. **Run Training:** Execute `python src/train.py` to train the model. Customize training parameters within the script.

**Key Steps in the Code**

1. **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries for deep learning, image processing, data handling, and visualization.
2. **Load and Preprocess Data:**
    - Utilizes `ImageDataGenerator` for image loading, rescaling, augmentation, and creating data generators for training/validation sets.
3. **Define CNN Model:** Constructs a sequential CNN architecture with batch normalization, convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.
4. **Compile Model:** Configures the model for training with Adam optimizer, sparse categorical crossentropy loss, and accuracy metric.
5. **Train Model:** Trains the model on the training data, monitors validation loss for early stopping, visualizes training/validation accuracy/loss curves.
6. **Evaluate Model:** Evaluates the trained model's performance on a test set (optional).
7. **Predict on New Image:** Demonstrates prediction on a new image (optional).

**Disclaimer**

This model is for educational and research purposes only. It should not be used for self-diagnosis or clinical decision-making. Always consult a qualified medical professional for any skin concerns.

**Further Considerations**

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with hyperparameters to potentially enhance performance.
- **Class Imbalance:** Address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
- **Model Explainability:** Explore XAI methods to understand model predictions.
- **Testing and CI:** Implement unit tests and explore CI tools for deployment.

**Contributions**

We welcome contributions to improve the model, expand its functionalities, or enhance documentation.
